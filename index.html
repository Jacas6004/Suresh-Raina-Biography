            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p class="para">
                Suresh Raina is a former Indian cricketer, born on November 27, 1986, in Muradnagar, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India.
                He was a left-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional off-spin bowler. Raina was an integral part of the Indian
                cricket team for many years, known for his aggressive batting and agile fielding.
                <br><br>Raina made his international debut for India in 2005 and quickly established himself as a reliable batsman in the limited-overs
                formats. He played a crucial role in India's success in T20 internationals and ODIs, including being a part of the winning squad
                in the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.
                <br><br>Apart from his international career, Suresh Raina has been a key player in the Indian Premier League (IPL), representing the
                Chennai Super Kings (CSK). His aggressive style of play and versatility made him a fan favorite in the T20 league.
                <br><br>Suresh Raina's impact on the cricket field extends beyond his batting prowess. He holds the distinction of being the
                first Indian player to score a century in T20 International cricket. His dynamic fielding skills and ability to turn
                the game with quick runs have left an indelible mark on Indian cricket.
                <br><br>In 2020, Suresh Raina announced his retirement from international cricket. He will be remembered as one of the finest middle-order
                batsmen and a dynamic fielder who contributed significantly to Indian cricket.
                <br><br>Raina's father, Trilokchand Raina, served as a military officer in an ordinance factory. The family left 'Rainawari' in Jammu and Kashmir
                during the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus in the 1990s and settled in Muradnagar town, Ghaziabad district, Uttar Pradesh. Raina trained at the
                Guru Gobind Singh sports college, Lucknow in 1998. He has a sister, and his elder brother serves in the Indian Army.
                <br><br>April 3, 2015, was the wedding of Suresh Raina and Priyanka Choudhary. The couple has two children Rio Raina and Gracia Raina.
                <br><br>Raina received an honorary doctorate from Vels University on August 5, 2022. On July 12, 2023, he celebrated the grand opening
                of his Indian restaurant in Amsterdam, where he serves authentic Indian cuisine.
